In a cigarrette, there is a substance named</p><p> "nicotine" in which, is the reason that smokers become addicted to smoking tobacco. Moreover, there are approximately 7000 </p><p>substances in a cigarette, at least 70 of which are cancerous! </p>

<p>Furthermore, smoking has been shown to have a significant impact on your mental health. For example, smoking have been </p> <p> associated with the cause of depression, anxiety, stress, guilt, low self-esteem and many other factors. The main misunderstanding</p> <p> that smokers make towards their smoking habit is that, smoking their cigarrette lowers their feelings of anxiety and stress</p> <p> because nicotine instantly settles them. This sensation is momentary and is swiftly followed by cravings and symptoms associated</p> <p> with withdrawal, therefore making it not a permanent solution to deal with their emotions. </p>

<p>There are many reasons as to why somebody may start smoking, however, there are some more common reasons. For instance, a </p><p>typical reason for somebody to start smoking is due to peer pressure by their friends, as they dont want to feel isolated from the </p><p>group or an outcast. People may also have begun smoking tobacco due to it being easier to manage social standings as they consider</p><p> it to make them feel more "relaxed". However, many smokers in today's society are people in their adulthood and mainly</p><p> later-adulthood. This is as a result of it being normal during when they were growing up, and some of the people in their</p><p> later-adulthood may have even been told that by smoking cigarrettes it brings you many health benefits!
